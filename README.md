# Neural Network Experiment Documentation

## Overview

This project is a hands-on experiment to understand neural networks better, specifically the mechanics of forward and backward propagation. I've trained on the Fashion-MNIST dataset and performed model evaluation, inference, and visualization on the same. Also, some activation functions and the ADAM optimizer are implemented too.

## Note

- Run the experiment in a Jupyter Notebook.
- Helper functions are provided in `nn_model.py`.
- The code prioritizes simplicity over efficiency.

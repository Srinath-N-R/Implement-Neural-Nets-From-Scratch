# Neural Network Experiment Documentation

## Overview

This project is a hands-on experiment to understand neural networks better, specifically the mechanics of forward and backward propagation. It utilizes the Fashion-MNIST dataset and supports model evaluation, inference, and visualization. Additionally, it implements various activation functions and the ADAM optimizer.

## Note

- Run the experiment in a Jupyter Notebook.
- Helper functions are provided in `nn_model.py`.
- This experiment serves as a learning tool to gain a better understanding of neural networks.
- It is not intended for production use, and the code prioritizes simplicity over efficiency.

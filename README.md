**Neural Network Experiment Documentation**

**Overview**

This project is a hands-on experiment with neural networks, to understand how forward and backward prop works. 
Fashion-MNIST dataset is used. Model Evaluation, Inference and Visualization is supported.
Also, activation functions and ADAM optimizer are implemented.

Note
Run the experiment in the Jupyter Notebook. The helper functions are present in nn_model.py.
This experiment was to help me understand neural networks better, and itis not for production use. The code is straightforward, prioritizing learning over efficiency.

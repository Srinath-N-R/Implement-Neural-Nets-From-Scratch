**Neural Network Experiment Documentation**


**Overview**


This project is a hands-on experiment to understand neural networks, specifically to see how forward and backward prop works. 
Fashion-MNIST dataset is used. Model Evaluation, Inference and Visualization is supported.
Also, activation functions and ADAM optimizer are implemented.


**Note:**

Run the experiment in the Jupyter Notebook. The helper functions are present in nn_model.py.
This experiment was to help me understand neural networks better, and itis not for production use. The code is straightforward, prioritizing learning over efficiency.
